Consider a real-world scenario to make this intuitive:

Suppose we’re studying the salary (y) of individuals based on:

education level (x), a continuous variable.
industry (z), a one-hot encoded vector representing the industry (e.g., tech, finance, healthcare).
In this model:

𝑔(x)
g(x) captures the non-linear relationship between education level and salary.
𝑧𝛽
zβ captures the linear relationship between industry and salary

Idea: To understand the relationship between salary and education, salary and industry, and their respective correlation to check the partial linear relation in the regression
